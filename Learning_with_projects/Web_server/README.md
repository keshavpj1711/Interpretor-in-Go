# What packages are we working with?

## `fmt`
Provides functions for formatted input and output operations like:

- `fmt.Println()`: printing values to console, followed by a newline
- `fmt.Printf()`: printing formatted outputs, this gives us more control over output layout
- `fmt.Scan()` and `fmt.Scanf()`: taking input from console
- `fmt.Sprintf()`: this is one of the strange ones, this is used for formating strings without printing then, this maybe useful in creating formatted strings.
