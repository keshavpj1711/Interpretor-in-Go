# Intro to structs
We use structs in Go to represent structured data. It's often convenient to group different types of variables together. For example, if we want to represent a car we could do the following:
```go
type car struct {
  Make string
  Model string
  Height int
  Width int
}
```
Structs has a similar usecase to dictionaries.\
Now as we already know how to define a struct lets actually use this created variable:
```go

```
